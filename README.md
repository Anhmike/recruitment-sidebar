## Unfinished tasks

I think I have finish all the tasks expect:   
1. The arrow to show / hide departments' positions (Since this feature haven't added, so it will be confusing if show the toggling arrow).   
2. The precise color value. (Currently I just use *color picker* to picker color value from the pdf file)   
3. The checkbox style. (I think if given both checked/unchecked style, I will do it immediately)


## Bug :bug:

I haven't test the components, If you find some bugs, please feel free to fire an issue :smile:.
